# Hi, my name is Francisco :)

Iâ€™m passionate about creating opportunities for **equitable and high-quality education**. For the past 8 years I've been helping institutions create skill-based curricula and delivering them. I am currently studying how to design high school systems and curricula that support **all students** to develop skills for life and work. 

I am also very interested in using **Artificial Intelligence** to solve education most pressing challenges and engaged with **Machine Learning** and **Natural Language Understanding** research.
